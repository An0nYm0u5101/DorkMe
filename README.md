# Add Dorks 

If you want to add new dorks put it in one of the files in the dorks folder (preferable in its category), if it is not, you can add it to mydorks.txt.
    to add it: in the first line add the dork, in the second the severity: high , medium or low, and finally its description, look at the other files to do it correctly

# Well... WTF is dorking?
   Google hacking, also named Google dorking, is a computer hacking technique that uses Google Search and other Google applications to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites use.
   
For example, SQL injection usually has this structure in the url "file.php? Id = [vuln]", to look for pages vulnerable to SQLi we can use the operator "inurl:", which only shows results with X string in the url , we can also use the "filetype: [extension]" operator to search for sensitive files, a hyphen in front of a word so that the word does not appear in the search, quote a phrase or word to ALWAYS appear in the search results, etc.
